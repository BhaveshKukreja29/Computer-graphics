A **Bézier curve** is a mathematical curve commonly used in computer graphics, animation, and design to model smooth and scalable shapes. It is defined using a set of **control points** that determine the shape and curvature of the curve. The Bézier curve provides a powerful way to represent complex shapes and smooth paths in a flexible and intuitive manner.

### Historical Background
Bézier curves were developed by French engineer **Pierre Bézier** in the 1960s, who was working at Renault at the time. His aim was to create a way to design the complex curves found in car bodies in a more efficient manner. Simultaneously, **Paul de Casteljau**, another French engineer working for Citroën, also developed a similar curve using a different mathematical formulation. However, Bézier's work became more widely known due to its use in computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and hence the curves were named after him.

### Why Bézier Curves?
In design and animation, controlling smooth and continuous curves is critical, but manually specifying the entire curve would be tedious. Bézier curves solve this problem by allowing you to define a curve using only a few control points, from which a smooth path is automatically computed. These curves are scalable, making them useful in vector graphics, where you need the shape to be scalable without losing its smoothness.

### Types of Bézier Curves
1. **Linear Bézier Curve (1st degree)**: The simplest form, defined by two control points. It's just a straight line connecting the two points.
   
   - Formula: \( B(t) = (1 - t)P_0 + tP_1 \)
   - Where \( t \) is a parameter that runs from 0 to 1, and \( P_0 \) and \( P_1 \) are control points.

2. **Quadratic Bézier Curve (2nd degree)**: Defined by three control points. It creates a parabolic curve that is influenced by the middle control point.

   - Formula: \( B(t) = (1 - t)^2 P_0 + 2(1 - t)t P_1 + t^2 P_2 \)
   - \( P_0, P_1, P_2 \) are control points, and \( t \) is the parameter between 0 and 1.

3. **Cubic Bézier Curve (3rd degree)**: The most commonly used form, defined by four control points. This allows for more complex curves and smoother transitions.

   - Formula: \( B(t) = (1 - t)^3 P_0 + 3(1 - t)^2 t P_1 + 3(1 - t) t^2 P_2 + t^3 P_3 \)
   - \( P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3 \) are the control points.

   This type of curve is often used in vector graphics (like SVG) and design tools like Adobe Illustrator or Figma.

### Properties of Bézier Curves
- **Control Points Influence**: The curve doesn't necessarily pass through all control points but is pulled toward them. For instance, in a cubic Bézier curve, only the start and end points are directly on the curve, while the other points "pull" it into shape.
  
- **Affine Invariance**: Transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling affect both the control points and the curve in the same way, preserving its shape.

- **Convex Hull**: The curve always lies within the convex hull of its control points. This means the curve never strays outside the polygon formed by its control points.

- **Recursive Definition (de Casteljau's Algorithm)**: The curve can be defined recursively using **de Casteljau’s algorithm**, which divides the curve into smaller segments, making it computationally efficient to draw the curve.

### How Bézier Curves Work (Intuitive Understanding)
Imagine you are moving along a line from one point to another, but instead of traveling in a straight line, your path is influenced by other points that pull you off course in a smooth, continuous way. The control points act like "magnets" that pull the curve towards them. The more control points, the more complex the curve can become.

For a cubic Bézier curve:
- \( P_0 \) is the starting point.
- \( P_3 \) is the ending point.
- \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) influence the direction and curvature, pulling the curve toward them but not necessarily lying on the curve.

### Applications of Bézier Curves
- **Computer Graphics**: Bézier curves are used in vector graphic design tools (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape) to create smooth and scalable shapes.
- **Font Design**: Many fonts are created using Bézier curves, making the text scalable without losing clarity.
- **Animation**: Bézier curves are used in motion paths to create smooth transitions in animations.
- **CAD Systems**: These curves are fundamental in modeling the shapes of cars, airplanes, and other products.
- **Web Development**: In CSS, Bézier curves are used to define smooth transitions and animations (e.g., `transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier`).
